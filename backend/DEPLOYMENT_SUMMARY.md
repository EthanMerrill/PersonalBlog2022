# HTTPS Setup Complete - Next Steps

## ‚úÖ What's Been Updated

Your project has been successfully simplified to use **Nginx reverse proxy only** for HTTPS. Here's what was changed:

### Files Modified:

- ‚úÖ **CloudFormation Template**: Added domain parameters and Let's Encrypt setup
- ‚úÖ **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Added domain and SSL email parameters
- ‚úÖ **nginx.conf**: Updated for Let's Encrypt certificate paths
- ‚úÖ **setup-letsencrypt.sh**: Simplified for Nginx-only architecture
- ‚úÖ **README.md**: Updated documentation for new architecture
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**: Complete rewrite for Nginx-only approach

### Files Created:

- ‚úÖ **GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md**: Comprehensive guide for GitHub secrets

### Architecture Now:

```
Internet ‚Üí Nginx (HTTPS :443) ‚Üí Go App (HTTP :8080)
             ‚Üì
    Let's Encrypt SSL Certificates
```

## üöÄ Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Set Up GitHub Secrets

Add these **new required secrets** to your GitHub repository:

```bash
# Navigate to: Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions

# New secrets for HTTPS:
DOMAIN_NAME="api.yourdomain.com"    # Your API domain
SSL_EMAIL="your-email@domain.com"   # For Let's Encrypt notifications

# Existing secrets (verify these are set):
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-key"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret"
AWS_KEY_PAIR_NAME="your-keypair"
JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"
AUTH_USERNAME="admin"
AUTH_PASSWORD="your-password"
ALLOWED_ORIGINS="https://yourdomain.com"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-firebase-key"
```

### 2. Prepare Your Domain

Before deployment:

- Set up a subdomain in your DNS (e.g., `api.yourdomain.com`)
- You can deploy first, then point DNS to the EC2 IP

### 3. Deploy

```bash
# Simply push to main branch:
git add .
git commit -m "Set up Nginx-only HTTPS architecture"
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions will:

1. Create/update AWS infrastructure
2. Install Docker, Nginx, and Certbot
3. Generate Let's Encrypt SSL certificate (if domain provided)
4. Start services with HTTPS

### 4. Point Your Domain

After deployment completes:

1. Get the EC2 public IP from GitHub Actions output
2. Point your domain's A record to that IP
3. Wait for DNS propagation (usually 5-15 minutes)

### 5. Update Frontend

Update your frontend to use the HTTPS endpoint:

```bash
# In your frontend .env file:
VITE_SECRETS_SERVICE_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com
```

## üîç Testing Your Deployment

### Health Check

```bash
# Test the HTTPS endpoint:
curl https://api.yourdomain.com/health

# Should return: {"status":"healthy"}
```

### Authentication Flow

```bash
# Test authentication:
curl -X POST https://api.yourdomain.com/auth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"your-password"}'
```

## üìö Documentation Available

- **[GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md](./GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md)**: Complete GitHub secrets guide
- **[HTTPS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./HTTPS_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)**: Detailed HTTPS setup guide
- **[README.md](./README.md)**: Updated architecture documentation

## üîß Development Mode

For local development without a domain:

```bash
# Leave DOMAIN_NAME and SSL_EMAIL empty in GitHub secrets
# Service will use self-signed certificates
# Access via: http://localhost:8080 or https://localhost (with cert warning)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Let's Encrypt Rate Limits**: Don't trigger deployments repeatedly if cert generation fails
2. **DNS Propagation**: Allow time for DNS changes to propagate
3. **Security Groups**: CloudFormation automatically configures ports 80, 443, and 22
4. **Certificate Renewal**: Automatic renewal is set up via cron job

## üÜò Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:

1. Check GitHub Actions logs for specific errors
2. Verify all GitHub secrets are set correctly
3. Ensure AWS permissions are sufficient
4. Check domain DNS configuration

## üéâ Ready to Deploy!

Your HTTPS setup is now complete and simplified. Just set up the GitHub secrets and push to main branch to deploy with automatic HTTPS!
