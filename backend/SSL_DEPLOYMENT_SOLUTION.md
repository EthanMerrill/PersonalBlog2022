# SSL Deployment Solution

## Problem Summary

The GitHub Actions deployment was failing because:

1. **DNS Resolution Issue**: nginx was trying to resolve `secrets-service:8080` at startup before Docker Compose network was ready
2. **SSL Certificate Loading Errors**: nginx configuration tried to load SSL certificates that didn't exist, causing startup failures
3. **Missing SSL Setup Integration**: SSL certificates weren't being configured during deployment

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Fixed DNS Resolution (✅ COMPLETED)

**Modified `nginx.conf`:**

- Added Docker's internal DNS resolver: `resolver 127.0.0.11 valid=10s ipv6=off;`
- Replaced static upstream block with dynamic mapping: `map $uri $backend_server { default secrets-service:8080; }`
- Changed all `proxy_pass http://backend;` to `proxy_pass http://$backend_server;`

### 2. Fixed SSL Certificate Loading (✅ COMPLETED)

**Modified deployment workflow:**

- SSL server block in `nginx.conf` is initially commented out to prevent startup errors
- SSL certificates are set up automatically during deployment
- nginx configuration is updated dynamically based on SSL certificate availability

### 3. Created SSL Management Infrastructure (✅ COMPLETED)

**Created `ssl-setup.sh` script with functions:**

- `auto` - Automatic SSL setup based on environment variables
- `self-signed` - Generate self-signed certificates
- `cloudflare` - Cloudflare SSL setup (placeholder for future implementation)
- `check` - Validate existing certificates
- `status` - Show SSL certificate status
- `renew` - Renew certificates
- `remove` - Remove certificates

**Enhanced `deploy-nginx.sh` script:**

- Added `setup_ssl_certificates()` function
- Added `enable_ssl_in_nginx()` function that creates SSL-enabled nginx config
- Added `ssl` command for certificate management
- Enhanced status reporting with SSL certificate information

### 4. Deployment Flow (✅ COMPLETED)

**New deployment sequence:**

1. Create necessary directories (`ssl`, `logs/nginx`)
2. **Setup SSL certificates** (new step)
3. **Configure nginx** based on SSL availability (new step)
4. Build Docker images
5. Start services
6. Health checks

## SSL Configuration Modes

### 1. Self-Signed Certificates (Default)

```bash
# Automatic setup (default mode)
./deploy-nginx.sh deploy

# Or explicitly
./deploy-nginx.sh ssl setup
```

### 2. Cloudflare SSL (Future)

```bash
# Set environment variables
export DOMAIN="api.yourdomain.com"
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your-token"

# Deploy with Cloudflare SSL
./deploy-nginx.sh deploy
```

### 3. Existing Certificates

```bash
# Place certificates in ssl/ directory
cp your-cert.pem ssl/certs/fullchain.pem
cp your-key.pem ssl/private/privkey.pem

# Deploy
./deploy-nginx.sh deploy
```

## nginx Configuration Behavior

### HTTP-Only Mode (No SSL certificates)

- Single HTTP server block on port 80
- All traffic served over HTTP
- Health endpoint available at `/health`

### HTTPS Mode (SSL certificates present)

- HTTP server on port 80 (health check + redirect to HTTPS)
- HTTPS server on port 443 with SSL termination
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect for all non-health endpoints
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Modern SSL/TLS configuration (TLS 1.2+)

## GitHub Actions Integration

**SSL Mode Selection:**
The GitHub Actions workflow supports SSL mode selection via input:

```yaml
workflow_dispatch:
  inputs:
    ssl_mode:
      description: "SSL Certificate Mode"
      required: false
      default: "cloudflare"
      type: choice
      options:
        - "cloudflare"
        - "self-signed"
        - "existing"
```

**Environment Variables:**

```yaml
# Set in GitHub Secrets
DOMAIN=api.yourdomain.com
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your-token
```

## Management Commands

### Deployment

```bash
# Full deployment with SSL setup
./deploy-nginx.sh deploy

# Start/stop/restart services
./deploy-nginx.sh start
./deploy-nginx.sh stop
./deploy-nginx.sh restart
```

### SSL Management

```bash
# Setup SSL certificates
./deploy-nginx.sh ssl setup

# Check SSL certificate status
./deploy-nginx.sh ssl check

# Renew certificates
./deploy-nginx.sh ssl renew

# Remove certificates
./deploy-nginx.sh ssl remove
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# Show complete status including SSL
./deploy-nginx.sh status

# Show logs
./deploy-nginx.sh logs nginx
./deploy-nginx.sh logs secrets-service

# Health checks
./deploy-nginx.sh health
```

## Security Features

### SSL/TLS Configuration

- **Protocols**: TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3
- **Ciphers**: Modern ECDHE cipher suites
- **HSTS**: 1 year max-age with includeSubDomains
- **Session Cache**: 10MB shared cache, 10-minute timeout

### Security Headers

- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### Rate Limiting

- **General**: 10 requests/second with burst of 20
- **API endpoints**: 10 requests/second with burst of 10
- **Rate limit zone**: 10MB memory zone

## File Structure

```

├── deploy-nginx.sh           # Main deployment script
├── ssl-setup.sh             # SSL certificate management
├── nginx.conf               # nginx configuration template
├── docker-compose.yml       # Docker Compose configuration
├── ssl/                     # SSL certificates directory

└── logs/                    # Log files
    └── nginx/              # nginx logs
```

## Testing the Solution

### Local Testing

```bash
# Clone and navigate to backend directory
cd backend/

# Test deployment script syntax
bash -n deploy-nginx.sh
bash -n ssl-setup.sh

# Test nginx configuration
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro" nginx:alpine nginx -t

# Test deployment (requires Docker)
./deploy-nginx.sh deploy
```

### Production Testing via GitHub Actions

1. Push changes to main branch
2. Check GitHub Actions workflow execution
3. Monitor deployment logs for SSL setup
4. Verify HTTPS endpoints are accessible
5. Check SSL certificate validity

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. SSL Certificate Generation Fails**

```bash
# Check SSL setup logs
./deploy-nginx.sh ssl check

# Manually generate self-signed cert
./ssl-setup.sh self-signed localhost
```

**2. nginx Fails to Start**

```bash
# Check nginx configuration
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro" nginx:alpine nginx -t

# Check logs
./deploy-nginx.sh logs nginx
```

**3. Backend Service Unreachable**

```bash
# Check backend health
docker-compose exec secrets-service wget -O- http://localhost:8080/health

# Check Docker network
docker network ls
docker network inspect backend_default
```

### Log Locations

- **nginx access logs**: `logs/nginx/access.log`
- **nginx error logs**: `logs/nginx/error.log`
- **Container logs**: `docker-compose logs [service-name]`

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cloudflare SSL Integration**: Implement automatic Cloudflare SSL certificate provisioning
2. **Let's Encrypt Support**: Add ACME client for automatic certificate renewal
3. **Certificate Monitoring**: Add automated certificate expiration monitoring
4. **Multi-Domain Support**: Support multiple SSL certificates for different domains
5. **Certificate Backup**: Implement certificate backup and restoration
